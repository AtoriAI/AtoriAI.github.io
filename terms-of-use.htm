        <div class="description">
          By using, visiting or accessing the Atori Website (collectively the "Website"), you agree to both these Terms and Conditions ("Terms of Use") and the Terms and Conditions of the Atori Privacy Policy, which are incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to any of these terms, you are not authorized to access or use the Atori Website. These Terms of Use apply to all users of the Atori Website, including, without limitation, users who are contributors of video content, photographic content, any written information, and other materials or services on the Website.
The Website is wholly owned by Atori (the "Creators") who reside in Copenhagen, Denmark.

          Website Access
        </div>
        <div class="description">
          The Creator hereby grants you permission to use the Website in accordance with these Terms of Use, provided that:
          <ol>
            <li>Your use of the Website is solely for your personal use</li>
            <li>You will not copy or distribute any part of the Website in any medium or manner inconsistent with these Terms of Use without the Creator prior written consent</li>
            <li>You will not alter or modify any part of the Website other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Website for its intended purpose; and</li>
            <li>You will otherwise comply with these Terms of Use.</li>
          </ol>
          In order to access some features of the Website, you may have to create an account. You may never use another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify the Creator immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
          The Creator reserves the right to establish data transfer restrictions and/or limit the total amount of data transfer associated with your account. User accounts may be closed by the Creator should the total amount of data transfer exceed an amount deemed excessive in the Creator's sole discretion.
          You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc., that accesses the Website in a manner that sends more request messages to the Creator's servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Creator grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. The Creator reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including but not limited to, account names, from the Website.
          You agree not to interrupt the services provided by Atori, introduce any malicious code or content onto Atori, or aid anyone in misusing or attempting to misuse Atori in any way.
